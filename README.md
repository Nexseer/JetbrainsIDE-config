> üéØ The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) offers a comprehensive set of software development tools, including a code editor, compiler, debugger, and often includes code analysis tools, a graphical user interface (GUI) builder, and version control support. IDEs are typically language-specific or support a few languages with deep integration features like auto-completion, IntelliSense, syntax highlighting, code suggestions, and automatic refactoring. An IDE can manage the entire project lifecycle, from writing code to building, deploying, and debugging. Due to its extensive feature set, an IDE usually consumes more system resources, making startup and runtime slower.

# I. Brief Introduction üîé

JetBrains IDEs are highly professional environments tailored to specific programming languages, known for their powerful intelligent coding assistance, debugging tools, and plugin ecosystem, all aimed at boosting developer productivity.

# II. Plugins üîå

`AceJump`: Improves code navigation efficiency by providing a keyboard-driven alternative to mouse operations.

`Atom Material File Icons`: Offers a set of high-quality file icons that visually differentiate between various file types, enhancing both the aesthetic and usability of the interface.

`CodeGlance Pro`: Displays a thumbnail view of the entire file structure on the right side, helping developers quickly locate specific sections of code.

`Codeium: Free AI-powered code acceleration`: Integrates AI technology to offer auto-completion, smart suggestions, and code generation for developers.

`Coderpillr Theme`: A favorite customized theme that enhances the visual experience.

`Ideavim`: Integrates the powerful Vim editing capabilities into JetBrains IDE, allowing for more efficient code editing.

`IdeavimExtension`: An auxiliary plugin that extends the functionality of Ideavim by adding many features not provided by default, further enhancing Vim operations within JetBrains IDE.

`Which-Key`: A shortcut key suggestion plugin that displays available options when developers input key combinations, aiding in shortcut memorization and improving productivity.

> ‚õî Disabling unnecessary built-in plugins (often marked as ‚ÄúBundled‚Äù) is an effective way to boost JetBrains IDE performance and simplify the development environment. By managing plugins wisely, you can create a more efficient and personalized development workspace.

# III. Custom Configuration ‚òëÔ∏è

By installing essential plugins, configuring the interface layout, and editor options, along with employing a few practical tips, you can quickly tailor JetBrains IDE into a highly efficient development environment that significantly enhances productivity.

## 1. Appearance

`Appearance & Behavior -> Appearance -> Theme -> Coderpillr Dusk`

`Appearance & Behavior -> Appearance -> Editor Color Scheme -> Coderpillr Dusk`

`Appearance -> Use custom font -> Cascadia Mono PL` `Size -> 16`

Theme and Editor Color Scheme are two related but distinct concepts within an IDE. They both contribute to the overall visual appearance of the editor, but their focus areas are different.

- `Theme` refers to the overall visual style of the entire IDE, not just the code editor. This includes the toolbar, menus, sidebar, status bar, and other UI elements. It determines the window background color, button styles, icon design, and more.

- `Editor Color Scheme` focuses specifically on the color settings of the code editor area. It defines the colors for different code elements (such as keywords, strings, comments, etc.), with the primary goal of enhancing programming efficiency and comfort. By using distinct colors, it helps developers quickly identify code structures and elements.

`Appearance -> Tree Views -> Show indent guides`

Enabling this option makes it easier to recognize nested structures, especially when working on complex projects.

`Editor -> Font -> Cascadia Code NF` `Size -> 24.0`

## 2. Other Settings

`Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings -> HTTP Proxy`

`Editor -> General -> Auto import -> Add unambiguous import on the fly`

Automatically adding explicit import statements helps resolve undefined or unimported references in the code.

`Editor -> General -> Appearance -> Show whitespaces`

Additionally, rendering blank characters improves control over code formatting and readability.

# IV. Shortcuts ‚å®Ô∏è

The `IdeaVim` plugin allows developers to enjoy the Vim editing experience within a powerful IDE. It provides many core Vim features while being intelligently integrated with the capabilities of the IDE.

## 1. `.ideavimrc`

The `.ideavimrc` file is similar to Vim‚Äôs `.vimrc` file, used to customize Vim key bindings and behavior. You can create or edit this file in your home directory.

IdeaVim supports many Vim plugin functions, enabling you to boost productivity by adhering to Vim habits.

You can use commands like `nmap`, `vmap`, etc., to customize key mappings. Combined with JetBrains‚Äô `:action` command, you can invoke IDE functionalities through Vim-like shortcuts.

```python
# Load NERDTree plugin
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
# Load surround plugin
Plug 'tpope/surround'

# Set leader key to space
let mapleader = " "

# Enable which-key functionality
set which-key
# Disable timeout, this prevents Vim from automatically aborting the input of a key combination after a long period of waiting. This gives the user more time to enter complex shortcut keys without worrying about timeouts.
set notimeout
# Enable surround functionality
set surround
# Enable word wrap
set wrap
# Enable easymotion functionality
set easymotion
# There will be at least 6 lines of visible buffer above and below the cursor position

## 2. Shortcut Organization

You can organize and customize your shortcuts by mapping your frequently used Vim and IDE commands to improve workflow and efficiency.
